            <h2 class="Goldlight">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2> <br>
            <p class="text-border">
                I want a job that is flexible where i can make a difference helping people while not having to worry
                about debt in an environment that doesnt force me to mask
                where I can be myself, and have the accomodations I need to be a productive member of the team.
            </p> <br>
            <h2 class="Goldlight"> description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning </h2> <br>
            <p class="text-border"> My stengths and limitations are the same. i think very literally and cannot
                understand subtext or nuances of neurotypical communication. this is great for tech learning but can be
                problematic when working with
                others due to communication breakdown. </p> <br>
            <h2 class="Goldlight">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
                while at Dev Academy?
            </h2> <br>
            <p class="text-border"> I am hoping I can develop my ability to express myself to others in a way that
                encourages teamwork. While I might never gain the ability to
                understand indirect communication, hopefully I can be better able to communicaate my needs in order to
                avoid misunderstandings and better able to work through them. </p>
