      <p>I had an issue with my javascript image expansion function that was creating a larger div than
        I needed that cover my clickable elements. I was unaware that the div was doing this and thought I was missing a
        line of code, I spent a long time trying to google this and it wasn't working.</p> <br>
      <p>I switched to te rubber ducky method and substituted the duck for a mentor. Through talking about the issue to
        a
        mentor i realised what the issue was and that i didnt need extra code, however I was still stuck on getting the
        expanded image to the right size, my mentors gave me a couple of hints and links to js tutorials that had the js
        terminology I needed. </p> <br>
      <p> I was quite confused until I used the rubberducky method as what I was thinking was happening and what was
        actually happening were completely different things.
        I learned how to talk through the issue to find what is causing the problem rather that assuming I know what the
        problem is. </p>

      <h5> The rubber duck debugging method is as follows: </h5>

      <p> Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).</p>
      <br>
      <p> rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if thatâ€™s all right.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by
        line.</p> <br>
      <p> At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what
        you
        are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.
      </p> <br>
      <h5> In a pinch a coworker might be able to substitute for the duck, however, it is often preferred to confide
        mistakes to the duck instead of your coworker.</h5>
