        <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical 
            decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
             the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </h2>
             <div class="boxed"> I always knew I was different growing up but never really understood why. 
                My family was not your typical kiwi family. I have a lot of cousins as my grandparents had 9 kids. and each of my cousins were mixed with another ethnicity. our Grandparents were Rromani but that was kept from us.
                See my ancestors had fled to New Zealand to escape the racism and hatren of the Roma that is still happening throughout Europe. The european authorities harassed us, made a slaves, stole our children had apathied laws preventing 
                us from associating or becomming citizens in the countriesd we had lived in for generations. This is still happening. 
                So many decided to leave when they heard about the new world. The thing is that realistically we are white presenting enough we can pass for white people, so that what my family did, hid out of some ships and came to NZ. 
                I am 6th generation now. My family ties into the colonial history of New Zealand but not the way most paheka do. My family when meeting the local indigenous realised pretty quickly that the british troops will be persecuting Maori
                much like the way we were, and so tried to build relations with the locals. I have stories of my family slipping past british lines to deliver goods to local tribes doing what they can while trying to draw attention to themselves. 
                But because of this, it meant my family had to give up a lot of our culture. 
                We lost our languages and many traditions. and while I am thankful I was able to grow up in a country like NZ it comes with the knowledge that i will never experience the richness of my ethnic people. 
                
                I guess because of this, I find racism easy to identify, I understand intergenerational trauma. I consider myself an ally to indigenous and bipoc all over the world, and identify as bipoc myself. 
                I want to reclaim as much of my cultures as I can. I have been research not just my Rromani heritage but also that of my nordic, scottish and sepphadic jewish history as well. 
                I threw away my christian beliefs that i was brainwashed with as a child and have been learning to reconnect with the religions of my ancestors. 
                I use the knowledge I gain to help ally anbd fight for others so people dont have to grow up cut off from who they are and have a very just personality.
                I try to hold other to account, and push for equality for all marginalised groups.
                
                I also belong to a few other socio culture groups outside of ethnicity. I am disabled with multiple health conditions and am neurodiverse. Im part of the rainbow mafia as well identifying as poly,pan, ace+, trans, agender.  
                All of these differences and growing up marginalised has made me very aware of society and the issues society as a whole is facing today.
            
            The bigest adjustment I had made in my life was accepting my neurodiversities. Bein autistic espoecially as my entire life i believe their was soimething wrong about me, when in reality i just
        spent a lot of time trying to fit in with neurotypical social constructs. Now that I know i am autistic and have begun socialising with the autistic community, I have found a place where i fit in and share similar
    values and ethics. I am rediscovering who I am. One way to to explain this would be to describe Neurotypicals having a windows operating system, and as kids everyone gets the windows operating guide. 
but Austistics are more like linux. and some autistics who got diagnosed in childhood get given their own linux operating manual, those of us us who got missed, end up with a windows manual for a linux system.
so we are trying to conform to the windows manual, we learn to mask, like creating an interface that mimics windows. and it kind of works, but at the core its different. Finally being diagnosed 
autistic means i now have the correct manual but i have go back and unlearn the windows, remove the windows interface i built and start learning this linux manual. 

this can create difficulties for me within in both groups. Nueortypicals Operating on windows still dont understand me as I am linux, but in the same way it can be hard to connect with autistics who grew up 
autistic since, they know their linux manual and dont realise that for us late diagnosed, we are only just learning it now and get confused between this new way and the old windows manual we kept trying to make work.
