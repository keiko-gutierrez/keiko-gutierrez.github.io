                <h6> Mindfulness
                    Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</h6>
                <p> I have grown up doing MBT( Mindfullness based therapy).
                    Mindfulness is really good to create a positive state of being. Mindfullness itself was designed
                    more
                    specifically for Neurotypical minds,
                    however when utilised in the right way can also work extrememly well for Neurodivergent people.</p>
                <h6> How did you find the overall experience? & What's your daily habit commitment?</h6>
                <p>its nothing new to me as I practice it reguarly
                    I spend at least 10 minutes a day practising active mindfullness. </p>

                <p>
                <h6> Listening and Looping
                    What was it like to be fully listened to? </h6>
                <p>
                    one of my biggest issues interacting with Neurotypicals is listening. This exercise was not
                    something i
                    personally could manage as its far too similar to active listening which is a trigger for me. </p>
                <h6> What was it like to fully listen?</h6>
                <p>i lack that ability. i am a great listener in my own autistic was but this type of listening is not
                    some
                    my
                    brains programming can comprehend
                </p>
                <p>
                <h6> Learning JavaScript
                    What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why?</h6>
                <p>
                    I realised that the formatting of the questions was quite confusing but learned new ways toi break
                    down
                    the
                    questions thanks to my mentors.</p>
                <h6>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the
                    basics,
                    or a feeling like you had to master the basics?</h6>
                <p> I dont use timebox, i find that i am always much quicking that the suggestions </p>
                <h6>DevTools Tutorial
                    What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash
                    course?
                    Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them? </h6>
                <p>I found the indirect communication a challange but with help from the mentors and other students,
                    were
                    able to translate the question into a more readable format.</p>
                <h6>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related
                    tabs to
                    distraction related tabs?</h6>
                <p> I have 11 tabs and 2 are not study related.
