                <h6> What are thre new things you have learnt about yourself
                    and your ego as a result of the core learning?
                </h6>
                <p> I havent learnt anything new about myself or my ego as a result of the core components</p>
                <h6> What are the roles of values and empathy and selfawareness in learning and programming. </h6>
                <p>there is none of that in programming computers are not sentient.
                    as for learning, i guess self awareness allows one to reflect on
                    which they have learnt. empathy is something that is a basic requirement of being human. </p>

                <h6> Listening and Looping
                    What was it like to be fully listened to? </h6>
                <p>
                    one of my biggest issues interacting with Neurotypicals is listening. This exercise was not
                    something i
                    personally could manage as its far too similar to active listening which is a trigger for me. </p>
                <h6> What was it like to fully listen?</h6>
                <p>i lack that ability. i am a great listener in my own autistic was but this type of listening is not
                    some
                    my
                    brains programming can comprehend
                </p>
                <p>
                <h6> What has surprised you about the core learning</h6>
                <p>
                    nothing </p>
                <h6>why do you think that we as a school are spending so much time focusing
                    on core learning in a web development programme. 
                </h6>
                <p> people skills are necceray in team environments and most programming jobs are team based  </p>
                <h6> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should 
                    you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. â€”
                     </h6>
                <p>I think its not a waste of time however, the core skills is very neurotypical focused. 
                    Considering most students are neurotypical thats great, its just becomes quite confusing for me.
                     But i think going foward with the boot cam strategy in place with Jean, 
                     i can get more out of the core skills</p>
